********************
Core Framework layer
********************

.. highlight:: bash

The core :term:`Framework` module is the backbone of the framework, on which all
other modules rely.

It is in the core were all the interaction with the underlying :term:`host type` is
performed, except when it comes to bootstrap of the DCC.

The module comprises four major components:

 * :ref:`The Host <host>`
 * :ref:`The Client <client>`
 * :ref:`The Engines <engine>`
 * :ref:`Notification and log management <log>`

.. _host:

Host
----

To use the Framework, a :term:`host` must be instantiated with an :term:`event manager`.

The host:

 * Loads the supplied context(task) from the FTRACK_CONTEXTID environment variable.
 * Discovers and validates each tool_config against its :term:`schema`.
 * Serves each :term:`Client` with data, handles context change.
 * Run tool_configs by instantiating an :term:`Engine`.
 * Manages logging by listening to client notifications.

.. _client:

Client
------

The :term:`Client` is the user facing component that communicates with host through
the host connection over the ftrack event system.

Clients are categorised into the engine types, see below.

Clients reads the tool_config and context from the host, and then commands the host
to run the augmented tool_config and its plugins with options collected from the user.

.. _engine:

Engine
------

An Framework :term:`Engine` is a module within the core that defines a function
and require an associated :term:`schema`. The current defined engine types are:

 * Publisher
 * Loader
 * Asset manager
 * Opener

.. _log:

Logs
----

Clients sends notifications to the host which is stored in an internal SQLite database
valid during the session.
