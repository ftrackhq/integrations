History
-------

With the first version of :term:`Connect`, the need to load and publish assets
within DCC applications were addressed but it was not easy to further customise
within an existing studio environment.

We realised our customers were not using the Connect integrations, more having
them as a base for inspiration when writing their own integration plugins.

Initial development commenced at ftrack 2018, with the first public release by
the summer of 2022.
