Install the DCC Framework plugins through the :term:`plugin manager` within
:term:`Connect` 2.

These plugins are prebuilt on :term:`Python` 3.7 and certified to be used with
public DCC application releases for Maya, Nuke and so on.

If the embedded Python version of your DCC application is incompatible with the
prebuilt plugins, you will be required to rebuild them and distribute them
separate as part of your studio configuration.
