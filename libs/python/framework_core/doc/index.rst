ftrack Connect Pipeline Framework
#################################


Welcome to ftrack-connect-pipeline's documentation!

.. important::

   This is the new DCC Framework for :term:`Connect` 2 written in :term:`Python`.
   If you are migrating from the old ftrack Connectors integrations then please
   read the dedicated :ref:`migration guide <release/migrating_from_legacy_connectors>`.


This document is intended to bring a deeper understanding of how the new
:term:`Framework` works under the hood, enabling developers to customise it to their
particular needs.

For a general introduction on how to install and use ftrack Connect 2 out of the box,
please head over here: https://www.ftrack.com/en/portfolio/connect

The documentation is divided into two main parts, the first part is where we describe
the new Framework and the second part is where we customise it to fit our needs.
